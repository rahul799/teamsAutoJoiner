<p><strong>6:55 - GAINING CONFIDENCE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Come prepared, do your homework</li>
<li>Trading is a skill that you need to acquire</li>
<li>You need to acknowledge the possibility of losing a trade</li>
<li>Confidence comes from your TA, experience and taking trades</li>
<li>You need to become a profitable trader over an extended period of time</li>
<li>Be strict with your rules and flexible on your ideas</li>
<li>We do not control the market but we are in control of our own trades</li>
<li>Never change your calculated invalidation point - you need to know how much you are willing to lose before you enter the trade not after</li>
<li>Expect the unexpected</li>
<li>Every moment in the market is unique. Risk management is the best way to be prepared</li>
<li>You have zero control of either the next trade will be winning or losing trade</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>27:57 - HOW TO HANDLE LOSSES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step back, bird’s eye view</li>
<li>Trading stop (10% rule) - you completely seize all trading activities, leave your trading place and stop trading for certain period of time</li>
<li>Understand why you are losing trades, JOURNAL everything</li>
<li>Heal, regroup, go again</li>
<li>Develop your own trading system - what works best for you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>44:00 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p><strong>6:20 - TRADING CHECKLIST - DOT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Technical analysis is very time consuming if you want to do it well - of course you do because money is on the line</li>
<li>When figuring out the trend environment, timeframe perspective is very important</li>
<li>It is good to trade the same coins because we can ‘get to know’ their characteristics, how they trade, we can build up statistics</li>
<li>Daniel places less emphasis on volume, delta and OI on HTF (especially on altcoins)</li>
<li>In general, he does not use order flow for trading altcoins</li>
<li>Daniel charts DOT/USDT on Binance because there is more data</li>
<li>He likes to check the volume (with fixed range tool) within the section an asset has been trading from the last high to the low</li>
<li>Regarding the trader checklist - the list applies to BTC and can be modified (shorter) for the altcoins</li>
<li>Price tends to fill the inefficiencies (SPs)</li>
<li>Daniel sees drops on assets he is bullish on as gifts</li>
<li>The longer the basing pattern the bigger the support and the move out can be very strong</li>
<li>Whatever moves down very fast can go up just as fast</li>
<li>You cannot trade without invalidation</li>
<li>On altcoins, obvious patterns do not fake-out that often (it happens a lot on BTC)</li>
<li>You always have to do TA on BTC first before trading an altcoin because BTC influences alts</li>
<li>You have to have confidence and stick to your plan</li>

<p><strong>2:23 - TRADING CHECKLIST</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As we know it is important to start with HTF</li>
<li>From HTF we gain directional bias on the HTF and recognize places we want to get involved to trade for high probability trades</li>
<li>At the HTF zone we must zoom out into a LTF (1H minus) chart to get an entry. Daniel likes 3-15 minute charts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5:03 - TRADING CHECKLIST QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are we in a 4H uptrend or downtrend?</li>
<li>Are we close to any Daily/Weekly/Monthly levels or CC Fib levels?</li>
<li>Are we making an impulse wave from a previous nice base?</li>
<li>Where are the key Weekly levels? (VAH, VAL, POC, major S/R)</li>
<li>Where have we opened today in relation to the previous value area? (above/below/ inside)</li>
<li>Where is the market trying to go? Is it doing a good job?</li>
<li>Is the volume, delta and OI following the move (much easier to read and more reliable on the LTF for scalers)</li>
<li>Do we have any CVD divergences (on LTF)?</li>
<li>Do we see an entry that offer a good R:R ratio? Where is our 100% invalidation and target before we enter?</li>
<li>Once we entered we need to know where is the next level where price can potentially reverse (know prior to entering)?</li>
<li>Is there a location coming up where price can move very quickly (e.g. breaking through a triple top)?</li>
<li>Where can I potentially re-enter if stopped out, or compound my trade?</li>
<li>Always know of the next level of potential reversal</li>
<li>A trade location that can be taken in the opposite direction</li>
<li>Plan for if current idea/trade is invalidated/stopped out</li>
<li>In trading, you can be right on an overall idea and get stopped out - thus knowing in advance your trading plan is very important</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>29:49 - EXAMPLES (ALWAYS BE PREPARED)</strong></p>
<p><strong>47:38 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel gives bullish CVD divergences in an uptrend the same weight as in a downtrend because he only looks at them at the level he wants to trade</li>

<ul>
<li>It all starts with this</li>
<li>When you don’t have a plan, you will fail</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9:02 - WHY HAVE A DAILY ROUTINE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daily routine helps you determine important levels and keeps you relaxed as you wait for the level to be hit</li>
<li>Most of the time Igor fills his journal even before entering a trade. He knows his R:R</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10:52 - WHERE DO I START WITH MY DAILY ROUTINE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Igor’s best indicator is price (open, close, high, low). He marks pDay, pWeek and pMonth levels</li>
<li>He marks HTF levels (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, S/R levels)</li>
<li>HTF &amp; local Fibs, OBs</li>
<li>Daily and weekly OBs are good for short term and long-term trades</li>
<li>He finds an area where there are likely to be buy/sell stop losses (liquidity)</li>
<li>Igor loves SPs. He marks Daily SPs and session SPs on a 5-minute TF</li>
<li>SPs are magnets to PA and also a bias (price goes from one to another area)</li>
<li>NPOC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>23:10 - CHARTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Igor shows how he marks levels on his chart and shows how he gets values in TV, Atas and Exocharts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>39:50 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Igor uses 5-minut chart for SP’s because they are the most respected on LTF - great for scalping and even when looking for a swing trade they give sniper entries</li>
<li>Igor sometimes uses body for OB and sometimes also wicks</li>
<li>Time is extremely important along with other technical confluences</li>

<li>We have checklists for swing and scalp trading (though even when scalp trading, Daniel would always do HTF analysis first)</li>
<li>We must start on the HTF and work our way down, starting on Monthly or Weekly chart</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9:00 - TRADING CHECKLIST QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the current Weekly trend?</li>
<li>How close is price to the last Weekly and Monthly levels of S/R?</li>
<li>Are we looking to trade a trend or a range on the HTF?</li>
<li>If in a trend are the Volume, Delta and Open interest following?</li>
<li>With BTC this is not always the case, context is very important</li>
<li>If in a range where price is in respect of VAL, POC and VAH</li>
<li>When price is in a trend but there is old prior range that was going for a few months, we should work out that range’s VAL, VAH and</li>
<li>POC to be aware of levels</li>
<li>Have we recently seen a larger OI increase with a reversal (with CVD divergences even better) to show trapped traders?</li>
<li>Where is the market trying to go? Is it doing a good job of getting there?</li>
<li>Are there any harmonics patterns on the HTF visible?</li>
<li>What is the general sentiment of the public/retail? Are there any obvious patterns everyone is trading?</li>
<li>Which side is currently in control?</li>
<li>Where is the next high probability swing trade?</li>
<li>After finding the location for the highest probability trade we go to the LTF (4H minus) to find our entry triggers (after doing HTF analysis)</li>
<li>Daniel is very good at sticking to his plans once in the trade</li>
<li>Don’t get thrown off by noise. Make a plan, trade the plan</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>35:35 - TRADING CHECKLIST PLAN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When swing trading Daniel places a lot of emphasis on what will destroy the majority of traders</li>
<li>Daniel places as much weight to psychology as to the TA</li>
<li>A lot of ‘gut feeling / intuition’ for how he will approach his swing trades then using the TA for his entry triggers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>45:00 - IGOR’S INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>54:52 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel knows if there is a harmonic on the chart within ten seconds (it comes with experience</li>
<li>You can look for trapped longs using delta and OI (plus CVD divergences)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>41:12 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, Daniel prefers to see ETH/BTC at the support before entering a long on the altcoin - it is not a requirement but a good factor to see</li>
<li>You have to be very patient with altcoins, be aware of fakeouts and trade level-to-level</li>
<li>With CVD divergences, you also have to be aware of context - they could be leading</li>
<li>Intuition and reading the market comes with experience</li>
<li>On SFP invalidation is always the low/the high</li>
<li>Confidence comes from when you know where you are wrong and where you are right</li>
<li>On a swing trade TP 1 can be very quick and small</li>

<p><strong>0:51 - LAST WEEK’S RECAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Probabilities are very important</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2:55 - LONG AND SHORT SIMULTANIOUSLY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel almost always holds at least 2 positions at the same time - from swing trading down to day trading</li>
<li>There are pros and cons to this and it is more advanced method</li>
<li>When Daniel has a really nice short position he will not close it when he enters a long position until he sees a sign of strength</li>
<li>He potentially closes the short if POC (or safer VAH) of the range is reclaimed</li>
<li>Keep your losses small and keep your winners run</li>
<li>There is no point in longing and shorting at the same price - this is gambling, not trading high probabilities</li>
<li>We want to take shorts only from high areas of resistance and longs from low areas of support</li>
<li>The reason why Daniel does this is to have that layer of being hedged (he trades with a large capital)</li>
<li>He will generally hold a short position longer for a sign of strength from the bulls as he has so much spot BTC to think about</li>
<li>He does not really need to take a leveraged long on BTC because he has a lot of spot BTC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17:53 - PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in a short from the top and long from the bottom it is a great way to see which one wins and turns into a swing trade potentially</li>
<li>This also helps psychologically - loss is much smaller than the winner</li>
<li>The psychological aspect of the hedge gives that slight subconscious confidence booster to take the next trade in the opposite direction</li>
<li>Using this method, you should see continuous, consistent uptrend on the overall ROI day on day</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>24:34 - CONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest con is that you will not make as much money as if you fully closed your trade and open the trade in the opposite direction</li>
<li>This method can be a bit confusing as you are having to manage (at least) 2 positions at the same time</li>

<li>With CCV set-ups you have to be aware of the context - even when there is acceptance above the pdVAH it is not a good idea to buy onto CC (or any other) resistance</li>

<ul>
<li>Igor time does not tell us the direction but often times there is a pivot low or pivot high put in at that time (with buyback)</li>
<li>With Igor time, you have to be able to read the context of the market correctly (it adds the confluence factor)</li>
<li>Majority of Daniel’s entries are at market and majority of exits of the trades are at limit</li>
<li>The context is the most important thing in trading</li>
<li>Rejecting off a HTF level with bearish divergences and new shorts opening on the way down ‘beats’ the intraday trade set-up (for instance CC+VWAP) - so if you want to take the very best trades you have to read the context correctly</li>
<li>Always trade level to level</li>

<li>Igor Times are from statistics gathered on where there is most volatility at set points during the day</li>
<li>Igor Times are subject to change should there be a new pattern emerge (just like the most volatile day is Wednesday)</li>
<li>Igor Time is different than Fibonacci time</li>
<li>Fib time is used to predict a move weeks in advance while Igor Time is used on the intraday basis</li>
<li>It is possible to use them together - for instance you have a date from Fib time and then use Igor Time for the move in that daily pivot</li>
<li>To predict the direction of the move you have to read the context correctly. If you cannot, then simply wait for the move to happen and then trade the reaction</li>
<li>The most common moves that happen on Igor time are SFP’s or the start of a major squeeze / move as volume is injected by the larger traders</li>
<li>Also, the moves do not happen on every Igor Session</li>
<li>Generally, the most volatility happens on Igor Session 3</li>

<p><strong>1:57 - IGOR SESSION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Igor sessions are taken from ‘Igor Time’ theory (in pt. 2)</li>
<li>Igor sessions are similar to TPO charts but Daniel trades them differently</li>
<li>They are primarily used by day traders (though swing traders can find them helpful)</li>
<li>Daniel likes to use the nsPOC of the previous session (as the level to be aware of)</li>
<li>From Daniel’s statistics, if you have one other strong factor of confluence with the nsPOC from previous session, there is 86% win rate.</li>
<li>The reason for this is the last session leaves ‘trapped traders’ and traders like himself using it to scalp trade from</li>
<li>Igor sessions can be used on the HTF in the same way as we trade nPOC on the daily</li>
<li>The reason Daniel prefers them on the LTF is because they provide amazing scalps from the previous session liquidity. That said, if a nsPOC is left on the HTF it is still something to be noted down</li>
<li>It happens quite often that the price is trading between two nsPOCs</li>
<li>Daniel would never trade nsPOC alone, there has to be confluence</li>
<li>One of his favourite set-ups intraday are a nsPOC onto the VWAP when the nsPOC is also a SFP type of set-up</li>
<li>A double session POC with a nsPOC is a very strong level (the more POC there are at a certain level, the stronger the level)</li>
<li>We can still merge profiles together in the Igor sessions</li>
<li>Daniel only likes to really merge Igor sessions together when the POCs are overlapping each other</li>
<li>As Igor sessions are used primarily for day traders it is helpful when trading a trending day</li>
<li>On a trending day, you should see the POC of each session rise and act as support. When the POC of the previous session is lost, it is a good sign that the trending day is over. It signifies weakness of the trend and price is likely to either consolidate in a range or retrace lower</li>
<li><em>NOTE:</em> Igor time is highly influential (in pt. 2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>30:18 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In this strategy volume is more relevant to be aware of - there are four sessions and you are looking for the trapped traders in the previous session not where the most time was spent</li>
<li>Daniel does not have a set period of how long the nsPOCs are valid for but he would not go back more than 2 weeks (usually just up to 7 days)</li>
<li>Daniel solely trades of nsPOCs not VAs or IBs at the moment (it may change)</li>

<ul>
<li>Daniel would never take a trade just because of single prints but he always looks for confluence</li>
<li>Daniel always trades of CVD divergences on LTF but is just aware of HTF (because it does not get you the entry)</li>

<p><strong>2:20 - TPO THEORY APPLIED TO BTC LIVE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We start on daily TF and find a range. When the range goes back further than you can merge in Exocharts, you have to either use Sierra Charts, Atas or simply TradingView. The last one only gives us the volume profile.</li>
<li>After marking daily range, switch to 4H chart and find local range. As the data does not go that far, you can merge on Exo.</li>
<li>Search for discrepancies, mark out the furthest out levels</li>
<li>Daniel trusts Exo the most when it comes to values</li>
<li>Then Daniel makes notes of nPOC’s</li>
<li>Daniel always merges TPO profiles of the area price came from (where the VA’s are very well lined up together)</li>
<li>There is never a random pivot, all is backed up with TA</li>
<li>When you see there is no trade based on TPO charts, use other tools, such as Fibonacci</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>39:05 - POTENTIAL TRADE SET-UP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The levels with the best confluence can still be broken that is why you never pre-set the level</li>
<li>Trade based off of the reaction</li>
<li>The other reason Daniel does not pre-set is also because the R:R ratio is then significantly worse</li>
<li>When price puts in the low, gets the good reaction, invalidation is very simple and small</li>
<li>Combining knowledge from before with the TPO theory you can work out very good entry, target and invalidation</li>
<li>Spending 95% of the time on analysis and 5% of the time taking the trade - we are very well prepared</li>
<li>The only thing is, you have to accept the trade can either win or lose even if the probabilities are high</li>

<p><strong>1:57 - QUICK REVIEW OF 2 TRADES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two trades taken this week applying the theory learnt thus far from the CC modules</li>
<li>Generally speaking moves that happen during the weekend reverse during the Sunday night going into the CME open.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9:33 - TIME VS. VOLUME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If time POC is different than volume POC it can give heads up to weakness</li>
<li>For swing trades Daniel likes to mark the levels ‘furthest out’ for the ‘best’ entries</li>
<li>Daniel always merges the range price is forming to get the values</li>
<li>A discrepancy between time and volume is where the POC’s are not at the same value</li>
<li>The majority of time the POC’s line up and that is normal</li>
<li>If the time POC and volume POCs are different this signals to us weakness in the move or consolidation</li>
<li>As we know with increases of price we want to see increases in volume to back up a healthy move</li>
<li>If price is spending a lot of time at the high (to create a time POC) but the volume POC is lower that shows us that volume is not matching the move upwards. Daniel would generally look to short the next rise - the best set-up is a SFP of the smaller consolidation</li>
<li><em>NOTE:</em> When the discrepancy is huge and the price is spending a lot of time somewhere not supported with the volume you can expect price to rotate back up towards the volume POC. This will then be a huge resistance (people taking profits, shorting, going out break even)</li>
<li><em>NOTE:</em> If the volume POC area had massive OI increases with positive delta it shows many trapped traders which can cause downwards pressure to continue. Therefore, checking OI and volume is a must</li>
<li>A discrepancy between time and volume although quite rare must be taken note of hundred percent of the time</li>
<li>Always check the volume POC area for the delta and the OI of the period. A tip for this is to look at the CVD divergences</li>
<li>If the CVD had risen greatly with high positive delta and the OI followed upwards it shows trapped longs (they are only trapped if price breaks the lows - change in MS)</li>
<li>One can use this theory on the LTF (daily TPO) and HTF (merged) for swing trades</li>
<li>If using this for day trading Daniel would use it to trade back to the mean volume of the day (such as VWAP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>34:33 - ONE TIMEFRAMING</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is when the candle / TPO of the TF you are looking at is not taken out during the move (easily read on TPO charts - always 30 min chart)</li>
<li>When market is one timeframing Daniel would never look to fade that move</li>
<li>It is almost always backed by large volume increase and can be decreased in OI as it is part of a short squeeze</li>

<p><strong>3:04 - MERGING PROFILES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Merging profiles is extremely helpful to get a better idea of where time is spent and where volume was transacted</li>
<li>Daniel likes to merge profiles from each trading range</li>
<li>Merged profile levels are stronger than the daily volume levels</li>
<li>Merging profiles together is a way of collecting all the data together and creating stronger data to trade from</li>
<li>Daniel merges together HTF daily profiles within a larger range to form one set of data</li>
<li>On the intraday he will always merge together ‘inside-days’</li>
<li>He also merges together profiles where price forms small deviations but goes back into the smaller range</li>
<li>The inside day - the day’s PA is inside of the prior day’s PA. Daniel likes to merge them together to get the average</li>
<li>Data we want to gather is the VAH, VAL and POC of the merged range</li>
<li>Daniel is still aware of the Daily POC etc. but he will place more weight on the merged profile range data</li>
<li>The reason for this is more volume + time + transactions have gone on over the whole range (more data = more helpful)</li>
<li>Time and price discrepancy is important information</li>
<li>When the range is well respected and the price leaves it, it is very likely if the price comes back inside that it will make a rotation to the bottom/top of the range (or at least the POC)</li>
<li>Knowing how many profiles should be merged together can only be learned via experience because there are no hard rules. It is all about visually recognising a range and merging those profiles together</li>
<li>When Daniel ‘predicts the range before it forms’ he merges the profiles together of the potential range</li>
<li>The reason this is so helpful is that you already have a great idea of the range levels ahead of the competition to trade from</li>
<li>Once the range is ‘complete’ the levels and profiles to merge become clearer, of course</li>

<li>Daniel does not use order flow when he trades altcoins</li>
<li>Fibonacci speed fan is very useful tool, Daniel uses it every time when analysing</li>
<li>For Daniel pulling a fixed range is natural</li>
<li>He also analyses how long price is auctioning at the lows and how long at the highs to determine if time aspect follows the price aspect (is volume lining up with the price). If POC is very close to the highs but the price spends the majority of the time at the lows it is more bearish - there are a lot of trapped traders.</li>
<li>To see if there is a CCV set up on TV, you have to check where the day opened and take the fixed range tool from there to previous day open and mark out pdVAL, pdVAH and pdPOC.</li>

<ul>
<li>Reaction at the midline is a key. The midline is at least a TP if not final target. If it offers no support/resistance you trade it to the outer line.</li>
<li>EW and pitchfork coincide nicely and wave 3 has to be impulsive therefore the target has to be low of the pitchfork (if down trending).</li>
<li>Fib pitchfork is for HTF analysis</li>
<li>Pitchfan is for time analysis</li>
<li>For confirmation you can use volume, OI, consecutive candle closes, SFP, etc.</li>
<li>If the pitchfork was relevant in the past it makes it very powerful but as always you need CONFLUENCE</li>
<li>History does not repeat exactly but it does rhyme</li>

<p><strong>00:02:50 - PITCHFORKS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Great to use on high time frames but can be used on any time frame</li>
<li>You need three pivots - first is the significant high, second is the low and the third pivot is a LH which can correspond with a CC (good confluence)</li>

<p><strong>00:10:20 - FLAT PRICE ACTION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once price reaches median line it can either break it and flip in support (target upper line) or rejects it and reverses (target the previous low). Context!</li>
<li>If price does not reach the middle line it can be classed as partial rise which indicates weakness.</li>

<ul>
<li>After identifying a pitchfork on a HTF</li>
<li>When Mike talks about specific levels especially on HTF he usually means a region.</li>
<li>You can pull the pitchfork from high that hit the main pitchfork, to the low and the SFP and then look for the median line. SFP could be then traded into a HL looking for the higher price to follow. This allows you to short in an uptrend and potentially look for a HL. Adding Fibonacci levels up the confluence</li>

<p><strong>00:02:28 - ETH/BTC LAST WEEK’S REVIEW</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:05:44 - EOS/BTC COTW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EOS was voted as the asset that most people on the stream were interested in. Daniel then deleted everything from the chart and started from beginning.</li>
<li>EOS is ranging for an unusually long period of time</li>
<li>Again, Speed fan is so underrated but so extremely powerful</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:29:33 - DAY TRADING STRATEGY </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This strategy is primarily based off volume (high and low of the candles, liquidity) and reactions</li>
<li>Daniel always waits for a reaction, he does not pre-set bids</li>
<li>Patience is very important with this strategy</li>
<li>With this strategy, you trade with momentum of moves</li>
<li>Key components
<ul>
<li>TPO charts</li>
<li>Open interest</li>
<li>Volume/momentum</li>
<li>Fibonacci</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This strategy gives 1-4 trades a day</li>
<li>When there is no set-up do NOT trade, but when the trade comes, it is usually a very good one.</li>
<li>MS, OI and volume show momentum of the move + Fibonacci is Daniel’s primary tool for confluence (entrance is not based off it)</li>
<li>TPO charts and volume tools (POC, VWAP etc.) give trade entry.</li>
<li>MS (15 min) shows trend (easier to monitor for newer traders)</li>
<li>Volume shows the strength of the move (more advanced method)</li>
<li>OI shows the aggressiveness of the move</li>
<li>Daniel obviously uses CC, but he also uses .796 fib in the low volume environments (ranging days) and .28 in high momentum environments (trending days) - CCW!</li>
<li>For this method TPO chart SP’s or HTN are highly favourable</li>
<li>Reading momentum and context is the most crucial - if you use a strategy but don’t understand how to gage momentum or context you fail. These two are the most crucial</li>
<li>In trending days, you have to look if longs or shorts are aggressive (in Exocharts). Also in ranging days when you look for pull-backs, knowing who is aggressive (momentum) is very helpful. Along with this, you have to see if OI is following the aggression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:42:09 - EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When there is an upwards move, it should be supported with NET longs pushing (aggressive)</li>
<li>One of the most common set-ups in this strategy is VWAP+POC confluence (first touch gives a trade)</li>
<li><u>Very good example</u>: There is a trending (downwards) day and price rises with big candles + some liquidations on declining OI. Price hits the dPOC + pdVAL + VWAP = short the bounce (CONTEXT)!</li>
<li>Understanding correlation with other assets (ES, DXY etc.) helps tremendously</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:51:50 - TEMPLATE EXPLAINED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is basically the all-in-one template (TPO chart, volume chart, candlesticks based off of volume, daily volume profile of last two days, delta profile of last two weeks (ultra-powerful), CVD divergence, OI, NET longs, NET shorts, H-L, Time and Trade counts.</li>
<li>It may seem perfect, but in fact perfect trading strategy does not exist.</li>
<li>The final piece of puzzle is found with experience</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:56:00 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel does not adjust the Speed fan when changing time frames (it is not incorrect though)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>01:15:27 - SUMMARY</strong></p>

<li>Momentum gives trade direction</li>
<li>Volume gives entries</li>
<li>Fibonacci gives confluence</li>

<p><strong>00:03:10 - ETH/BTC COTW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel changed his approach a bit - ETH was voted as the asset that most people on the stream were interested in. Daniel then deleted everything from the chart and started from beginning</li>
<li>Speed fan is a very powerful tool</li>
<li>Daniel takes the fib from where the move gets very impulsive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:28:14 - VOLUME SPECIFICS - DANIEL’S SCALPING/DAYTRADING STRATEGY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first part (next part next week)</li>
<li>We look at the H-L to identify the liquidity in the market</li>
<li>If price is breaking through a level but the H-L are larger than the average it is likely to be a fake-out</li>
<li>When price breaks through a key level of the day (POC, monthly level, weekly level, CC, a high or a low etc.) and the candles are larger than the average it is likely to be a fake-out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:31:47 - AN EXAMPLE OF LOW LIQUIDITY TRADE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is such an advantage to trade with volume candles because it ignores all the noise, the candle only gets printed when it needs to and also you can see the strength and momentum of the move as well as the liquidity in the market.</li>
<li>You are looking for the liquidation run into a SFP and then the rapid buy-back on a very few big candles (lack of liquidity)</li>
<li>When something like this occurs and you see orderbooks really thin you look to fade that move. Price may also form a range</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:35:50 - AN EXAMPLE OF HIGH LIQUIDITY TRADE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of small H-L’s equal high liquidity. If price hits a key level (any) and the H-L are smaller than average but CVD is breaking up, it shows bigger traders are absorbing buy orders (or sell orders, depends where it is located)</li>
<li>In this example, there are lots of small candles going into HTF resistance. Price forms bearish CVD divergences and then sells off.</li>
<li><strong><u>NOTE</u>: </strong>trade CVD divergences in high liquidity environments
<ul>
<li>When price builds up on very small candles it shows a lot of volume is going into this but the price is not advancing sufficiently = larger traders are absorbing several hundred million of orders. When price then retests that same level on OI building up with it (=a lot of new longs opening) and you get the bearish CVD divergences on top of that and the sell-off occurs on a lot of small candles, it is sustained. That shows the bigger trader is getting out of his position on a sustained move. There is an acceptance in price going down. This type of day trades are the best.</li>
<li>On top of this you can check the trade count. You should look for low trade counts because they highlight exchange/high volume trader. When there are for instance ten 5 million candles and eight are built up with 1000 trades and then two 5 million candles in a row are built with one or two trades. That shows larger traders are trading at that level. If this is starting to be a trend, the larger player has made a decision and with following the footprints you should be monitoring and recognizing what is happening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:41:42 - ANOTHER EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price rises on large candles and then goes sideways as bearish CVD divergences form. Sell off on low trade count. Whoever was absorbing orders decided the direction of the market. You want to trade with the trend and in this case short every rise that occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:42:49 - RECAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes time to master this. Firstly, you have to recognize that high or low liquidity, then understand the TA that you use within that environment would be scientifically different.</li>
<li>To know either you want to join a move or fade a move gives you a massive advantage because majority of the market does not understand that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:45:18 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly and yearly levels are relevant but in crypto there is not too much data so Daniel does not really refer to them (only stock market)</li>

<p><strong>00:06:20 - VOLUME CHARTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume chart prints new candle after a specific amount of volume has been reached
<ul>
<li>For instance, when you select Volume 10M there will be new candle printed after candle reaches 10 million transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This chart type can be used in combination with footprints, imbalances and delta cluster candles</li>
<li>They are great way of seeing when momentum is picking up but on trend reversal type they are not so useful because you cannot see the wicks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:08:26 - DELTA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta charts print a new candle after a specific amount of delta has been reached</li>
<li>They are useful to monitor when you want to see incoming market orders (they move market)</li>
<li>This concept is a bit simpler than other types (yet very useful)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:10:48 - TIME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time is very valuable as you can see how much time is required to print a new candle. You can easily spot when volume is picking up because you see candles forming faster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:12:32 - EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you look at the volume chart and bars are becoming larger and larger it shows there is less liquidity (price just ‘slides’ through) and volume is bad</li>
<li>Zeros on the right side indicate there are no buys which means no liquidity - OI shows the same</li>
<li>When candles start being smaller and more compressed and price approaches a key level, it shows move is more reliable - there is more liquidity</li>
<li>It is impossible to determine the low but it is possible to determine whether price will break out or not when you look at the volume chart. When candles are being printed in short(er) periods of time it signifies there is a ‘volume injection’.</li>
<li>Mike likes to use 10M volume bars</li>
<li>When price is reaching a key level, you can see where in candle delta is taking place. Then you can see if there are any trapped traders for instance. Volume chart is nice for scalping.</li>
<li>Delta charts can take a little longer to form because new candle is created only when there is either negative 5M delta or positive 5M delta (if you look at D-5M)</li>
<li>You can determine either attempt to break a high/low is strong or weak seeing how fast delta candle was printed. Mike also likes to see how many trades took place in that candle and how many of them were buys and sells. Less trades mean bigger orders.</li>
</ul>

<li>Range, range-y, tick, trend reversal, volume, delta chart</li>

<ul>
<li>When you master all these chart types you can add more complexity</li>
<li>There is no best chart type. It all goes down to personal preferences and the type of trader you are.</li>

<p><strong>00:17:46 - TREND REVERSAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A really nice chart type</li>
<li>Can be found on Exo Charts</li>
<li>Trend reversal candle consists of a mixture of the Range chart and the Tick chart</li>
<li>There are two types of bars in one chart
<ul>
<li>Tick trend / trending bar</li>
<li>Tick reversal / reversal bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you select for instance a trend rev 78-48, the first number refers to trending candles. There will be a new trending candle created every 78 ticks (39 dollars). The second candle is a reversal candle. A new candle gets printed every 48 ticks in the opposite direction of the previous candle. So basically, large candles are trending candles and small candles - possibly with the wick - are called reversal candles.</li>
<li>Wicks in this type of chart ae different and it is important to understand them correctly so that you can read the chart correctly.</li>
<li>In this charts wicks are called shadows</li>
<li>In a trend rev chart, wicks are always directed against the candle direction. So, there can never be a red candle with the wick to the downside and there can never be a green candle with the wick to the upside. This is useful because you can see where the price is attempting to go but failed to stay.</li>
<li>The good side of this type of chart is that it removes noise.</li>
<li>These candles are good to see clearly if the price is consolidating or trending and also, it is easier to read horizontal support/resistance levels.</li>
<li>When you know how to read the you can combine them with reading volume, delta, it is easy to spot S/R levels etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:32:30 - AN EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A very nice example of how reading this chart helps you spotting reversal easier.</li>
<li>Upon approaching a key level there was a reversal bar - price tried to push up but the reversal candle indicates reversal (with trapped traders)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:37:54 - BTC TA</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:45:18 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the reversal candle is forming it can have reversal wick on both sides but when it finally forms, the wick can only be on one side.</li>
<li>Keep in mind reversal candles can also be printed in ranges or at the key levels</li>
<li>Big wicks indicate large orders</li>
<li>The higher number you use, the higher the TF that you are looking at</li>
<li>You have to use another tools/indicators for confluence</li>
<li>If price is pushing up and forming a red candle it indicates a reversal candle but if there is positive delta in that candle it is contradicting so you have to be careful. In this case there will either be a reversal or the price will be ranging more.</li>
<li>When there is big volatility Mike uses higher trend rev charts but in general he uses whatever looks best for him in given moment</li>
<li>When the candle is forming it is difficult to see where the POC of candle is. It is best to wait until it is formed completely or use the lower trend rev chart.</li>

<p><strong>00:01:40 - ALGO/BTC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A nice example of an iH&amp;S</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:15:25 - CHART TYPES (EXO CHARTS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Different chart types can help us traders to take better trades</li>
<li>By reading these charts you can move away from time frame and you can read momentum in variety of different ways</li>
<li>Because you do not have to wait for arbitrary TF close for confirmation you can enter a trade early</li>
<li>There is less noise on the chart, only useful data one would like to see</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:19:13 - RANGE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A range chart creates a new candle every 6 ticks (3 dollars) in price change.</li>
<li>Sometimes there can be slippage as well</li>
<li>It is beneficial to see how long each candle takes to form on Exo</li>
<li>With range chart you can measure volatility and identify S/R levels</li>
<li>You can see buy and sell pressure and foresee potential reversal coming</li>
<li>Mike likes to use this chart in a channel as it can give you heads up</li>
<li>Large candles mean there is a lot of big orders being processed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:26:29 - RANGE Y</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a modification to remove more noise</li>
<li>It calculates how far price moves from the open</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:33:53 - TICK</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One tick is one transaction</li>
<li>Mike likes to scalp off of these charts</li>
<li>If candles are printing rapidly it signifies volatility is picking up</li>
<li>You can see when bigger players are entering the market (how much volume was transacted in the certain amount of trades)</li>
<li>If there is a very compact candle with high amount of delta that signifies that there is absorption going on (big trades are happening and price is not doing much)</li>
<li>This chart type is suitable for scalp traders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:44:27 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mike likes Tick-230 chart the most</li>
<li>If price is moving up and you suddenly see big market sells coming in it shows the top is heavily sold (useful with range chart). When approaching resistance line, you can see if the top is getting sold. If longs are taking profit or people aggressively selling the top this can be an early indication that the price is at the top of the range. So, short would be the safer trade.</li>
<li>If the price is going up and you see big market buys coming in and OI is going up that shows you the move up is healthy (trade with momentum)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>01:01:56 - BTC TA + EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When price approaches a specific level, you should see the volume, how fast it is approaching and how big is the candle. If the candle is big it shows there is volatility and big orders being processed. If the candle is small and there is a lot of volume in it, it shows there is struggle going on and if you see negative delta and volume increasing on the next candle you can clearly see price is rejected</li>

<p><strong>00:03:02 - EOS/BTC </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel trades USD pairs now because he moved to Bybit exchange and there are only USD pairs</li>
<li>He does TA on BTC pairs because USD pairs are correlated to BTC anyway, so if BTC pair is doing well, USD pair will move too</li>
<li>This also means he trades only a few altcoins now</li>
<li>EOS is one of the best range bound coins (Weekly to Weekly)</li>
<li>Once higher Weekly gets broken it will fly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:08:57 - BTC LTF TA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One should always look at bullish and bearish perspective and see what is most likely. There are never any guarantees in trading but see which is more probable to play out.</li>
<li>Your bias should not blind you - even if you are bullish, if there is evidence to short, you short</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:14:51</strong> <strong>- BTC HTF TA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mike highlights important levels</li>
<li>One step at the time - until big levels are cleared one should not get carried away. As always, trade the chart</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:25:41 - CVD vs RSI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to read divergence correctly</li>
<li>RSI is totally different indicator than CVD.
<ul>
<li>RSI is lagging indicator and it indicates momentum. It is calculated from candle closes.</li>
<li>CVD is leading indicator. It shows the absorption of aggressors by larger limit orders. It is a pressure of buying and selling and is calculated from the whole candle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:35:05 - PSYCHOLOGYCAL ASPECT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have two jobs - to do your TA and to execute the trade</li>
<li>You should not be feeling the expectations you have towards the trade</li>
<li>For instance, you find a pattern that has 70% chance to give the positive result. That is great, but you also need to know, there is 30% chance it will not play out and manage your expectation. There are only probabilities in trading, no expectations. Keep playing the probability ‘game’ with the edge that TA gives you and keep on logging trades in your journal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:59:35 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever there is a bit of a doubt about how TA will play over the night, Daniel goes into x1 short to maintain USD value (especially when you are a fulltime trader)</li>

<p><strong>00:01:10 - BAT/BTC</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:07:42 - VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a S/R line</li>
<li>It is nice because it incorporates price and volume which we love to trade off of</li>
<li>It is good to enter with bigger position at the VWAP because there is a lot of volume transacted and you can fill bigger position with little slippage</li>
<li>VWAP is brilliant for scalp trading</li>
<li>It is good for scalp and swing trades</li>
<li>HTF VWAP is a very strong S/R line</li>
<li>When price is above VWAP it is ‘above value’ and when it is below VWAP is it ‘below value’.</li>
<li>When the HTF VWAP (yearly) gets touched for the first time after trending one would expect a strong reaction. Context is very important</li>
<li>Weekly VWAP is a level that gets interacted quite often</li>
<li>Daniel uses session VWAP, but is aware of Weekly VWAP too</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:15:53 - EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When VWAP is lining up with another confluence such as Fibonacci or POC it gives great trades</li>
<li>When scalp trading you have to be very strict, no emotions.</li>
<li>VWAP works extremely well with VAH, VAL, POC, CC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:35:01 - LIVE EXAMPLES ON TV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VWAP Anchored is a nice feature on TV. If there is a very big reference level (the significant low or high) this tool gives you VWAP of that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:40:43 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If possible is best to get into position at limit order, especially if you are scalping tiny range. If the move is a bit bigger it is acceptable to enter at market</li>
<li>Daniel does pre-set orders if there is good confluence for him. When price breaks through VWAP it is ‘expected’ to hold for (at least) the first touch if there is another level of confluence (CC/POC etc.).</li>
<li>VWAP lags behind PA so it is more likely to see price in a trending market to get a VWAP off of CC then the .382. It is lagging indicator, it cannot predict price</li>
<li>If Daniel goes for tiny moves his invalidation can even be 1 dollar, he is tight on his invalidations, especially if he buys at market</li>
<li>On Exocharts Daniel scalps these moves on volume chart, on TV is ok to trade on 3-5 minute chart</li>
<li>On Exocharts VWAP is always set as session</li>
<li>For swing traders Weekly and Daily VWAPs are useful</li>
<li>Daniel likes to build statistics by recording present time than checking what happened in the past - if something happened in the past it does not mean it will be keep on repeating.</li>
<li>In crypto session refers to 12pm UTC to 12 pm UTC (one day is one session). In stock market session is from open to close of the market.</li>
<li>Daniel does not use Weekly VWAP tool for trading but he is aware of it, he likes to know where it is, because it is a big S/R level. He would never take a trade off of it.</li>

<p><strong>00:13:46 - DAILY OPENS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This theory comes from stock market but also works very well with crypto</li>
<li>Daniel monitors the first hour of daily open, it is very important
<ul>
<li>Is there a strong move or is price moving sideways?</li>
<li>Check volume, dollar amount that price moved on daily open, where it opened - below/within/above VA</li>
<li>One can trade then retest/strength</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are three important open strategies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:18:08 - INITIAL BALANCE (IB)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial balance is the first hour of the trading day</li>
<li>Daily open is at 00:00 UTC time</li>
<li>Because crypto is 24h market, tests can take longer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:20:57 - OPEN DRIVE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When price potentially (not required though) opens outside of VA and continues in a direction quickly with volume</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:22:56 - OPEN TEST DRIVE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starts off slow, tests daily open and then rejection occurs with volume</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:24:45 - OPEN REJECTION REVERSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The open makes a weak directional move, tests a key level which is strongly reversed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>BONUS TIP</strong></p>
<p>If there is an impulsive move but is not backed by so much volume there is a high likelihood that the high will be put in in the first 24 minutes. That move then fizzles out and price goes back below daily open. So, there is a high likelihood that was the top, you can short the move and put SL above the high.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>00:27:42 - OPEN DRIVE WITH EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invalidation is if price goes back to daily open, though Daniel uses MS as SL</li>
<li>If there is a strong IB and price retraces back to CC, it is a good setup</li>
<li>But as always <u>context</u> and <u>confluence</u>!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:34:12 - OPEN TEST DRIVE WITH EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the most talked about (though it does not happen too many times)</li>
<li>There is choppiness at the beginning at the move</li>
<li>The invalidation is back below/above daily open</li>
<li>The confidence of differentiating between open drive and open test drive comes with the experience (you get the ‘feel’)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:42:39 - THE OPEN REJECTION REVERSAL WITH EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It gives a weak IB - price searches to test a key reference level (VAH/VAL/fib/horizontal level etc.)</li>
<li>Price comes and tests the key level and rejects with an increase of volume. Conservative trigger is when price goes through daily open. Daniel trades the key level though, he does not wait if he sees evidence.</li>
<li>Invalidation is back above key level</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>00:17:12 - ROUTINES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a plan your plan is to fail</li>
<li>Daniel is always <u>prepared</u> for the day ahead</li>
<li>He marks out his <u>key levels</u></li>
<li>He <u>plans</u> all possible trade setups (bullish and bearish)</li>
<li>He only takes the trade that comes to him (no pressure, Daniel trades whenever he wants to, whenever the setup is there)</li>
<li>Not taking a trade is a trade</li>
<li>In a daily trading sheet, he has all the key reference levels and knows which setup he will take. He is prepared for the setups before they are visible (new daily updates!)</li>
<li>Every single morning you should work out the context because it gives you base and understanding the structure for the day</li>
<li>Keep things simple in trading in order to not get lost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:22:07 - CONTEXT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel firstly identifies the context - <u>trend direction</u> on LTF (15min to 1h) and on HTF (1 day chart). If something goes sideways you trade it different than if it is trending. This has a massive impact on the whole day, it is one of the first things to write down
<ul>
<li>If something is trending Daniel is buying dips and trailing SL, not taking profits</li>
<li>If something is going sideways he does not add to the position, he buys at the low of the range and sells at the high of the range</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Higher time frame EW</u> <u>count</u> is also extremely important
<ul>
<li>If price is for instance in trending wave 3, Daniel will be aggressively longing the dips, compound and trail SL</li>
<li>If Daniel thinks price is in a 4 wave triangle, he will be expecting ranges, taking TP’s, and interested in longing lows and shorting highs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>CVD divergences</u> - when in sideways range, Daniel looks for CVD divergences to get the context of what the larger trader is doing</li>
<li>These will give Daniel a daily bias and he will then decide if he is more bullish or more bearish for the day and he will take longs/shorts accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:28:12 - IMPORTANT LEVELS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CC Fibonacci global and local</li>
<li>4 hour EMA’s 55 and 200</li>

<li>Identifying these levels gives Daniel an edge, it identifies his setup</li>
<li>Knowing exactly where you want to short and where you want to long in advance gives you a massive advantage. No plan loses you money.</li>
<li>After you identify all these, set an alert and wait.</li>

<p><strong>00:01:56 - LINK COTW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although Daniel is teaching more advanced theories - the more videos we go through, the more advanced the content gets - we should not forget the core key theory. It all starts with <u>horizontal levels</u> and <u>Fibonacci</u>.</li>
<li>LINK has an amazing respect for the 0.66 and in general it trades very technically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:07:20 - THE 80% TRADE SETUP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price remains range bound more than it is trending, therefore we long the lows and short the highs instead of trading for breakouts constantly.</li>
<li>The 80% setup we have is when the market opens outside the previous day VAH or VAL but then becomes accepted back into the VAH or VAL.</li>
<li>If day opens outside the value one would expect continuation. If you get acceptance outside of that value and volume increases than you don’t expect the price to reverse back to previous day value. So, if it does, the value has not shifted and it remains the same as the previous day, thus you expect the full rotation back to the high/low of the previous day.</li>
<li>The acceptance back inside the VAH or VAL is classed by two consecutive 30 minute candle closes in the value area with the volume (not required though). The theory behind this setup is that a VAH/VAL should act as a support/resistance level once broken. And if price is in a range and market is opening outside of the previous day’s VA but then gets accepted back into it, you would expect price to continue to range back to the other side of the previous day’s VA.</li>
<li>Context and confluence are very important, you should not blindly enter a trade based on this theory.</li>
<li>To get the highest probabilities trades you have to factor in confluences and context. Two <u>key questions</u> to ask yourself when wanting to trade:
<ul>
<li>What direction is the market trying to go?</li>
<li>Is it doing a good job in its attempt to go that way?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daniel named this theory <u>CCV</u> - Chart Champions Value setup</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:15:21 - EXAMPLE OF THE TRADE DANIEL DID NOT TAKE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Context - nothing in the chart was signalling the rejection</li>
<li>Also, you need to have a feel for market which comes with experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:22:19 - CCV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The distance from the daily open to the pdVA and the width of the VA are two important components we have to review before entering a trade under this setup. If yesterday was range bound and the following day opens outside the VA in a low volume range, one would expect this to be the ‘perfect’ scenario for a setup.</li>
<li>Whereas if price has just broken out of the range on large volume, the setup rules would be met officially but of course it does not make sense to trade the setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:25:24 - EXAMPLES OF CCV </strong></p>
<p><strong>00:37:29 - CCV RECAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We always know to check the context and confluences before entering the trade</li>
<li>If prior day was range bound it increases the probabilities the setup will be taken</li>
<li>If price closes outside the value and the following day gets accepted back into prior VA price is telling up it is likely to continue to be range bound as the market works out its true value</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:41:18 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This theory works across all the markets</li>
<li>CCV does work on HTF as well but the theory is a little bit different (needs a whole live stream)</li>
<li>If the setup is presented but the R:R ratio is not good, Daniel will still take the trade. He is a pro, so he ‘bends’ the rules a bit for himself</li>
<li>You don’t need to wait for two 30 minute closes if you see the volume coming in</li>
<li>The liquidity, volume, OI and context in the range that you are trading determine either the price will slowly grind or there will be a quick wick. There is no guarantee, just likelihood. Every setup has a different context</li>
<li>Invalidation of this trade is based on MS. Daniel uses wide stop losses, tight stop loss can actually lose you a lot of money. So that’s the irony - people use tight stop lose in order to not lose much money but at the end the actually lose more money because they are continuously getting stopped out.</li>
<li>Daniel does not like the session volume on Trading View because it is calculated differently than on other (pro) platforms.</li>
<li>In Trading View you can mark the daily open manually, then capture the 24 hours before daily open and you get the pdVAH and pdVAL.</li>

<p>The information Daniel gives in this stream is massively crucial. He goes through imbalance on ‘live’ examples. It is a practical lesson, it clarifies A LOT.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>00:02:13 - ETH/BTC COTW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ETH could have a crucial connection with BTC</li>
<li>If two levels are very close to each other, Daniel prefers to keep the HTF level on the chart (but is also aware of the other level)</li>
<li>For Daniel to trade altcoins, he has to see the strength in ETH</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:08:38 - IMBALANCES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel likes to use Exo Charts (but you can use any other).</li>
<li>The main things to look at with imbalances are:
<ul>
<li>absorption,</li>
<li>SFP with trapped traders,</li>
<li>stacks (stacked imbalances that act as support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daniel likes 15 minutes chart but it depends on the time frame that fits you (Daniel likes taking scalps as well)</li>
<li>The time frame you trade is the one you concentrate on</li>
<li>Daniel trades imbalances off of his reference levels = the levels he is primarily trading off of.</li>
<li>You should never be in a scenario that you are just trading to trade</li>
<li>You have to view trading as a business - make or break, fully concentrated so that you can be(come) consistently profitable.</li>
<li>You have to have your rules (for instance that you will always take a trade when there is 0.618 on the Weekly level) and mark up your chart</li>
<li>You have to look at the imbalances on the high reference region where you intend to buy/sell but when price is in between you should not be interested.</li>
<li>Daniel prefers to not set any bids/asks if he is at his computer but to see the reaction instead. Example:
<ul>
<li>When price comes down to his reference area he’d look if there is absorption at the lows. The aggressive option is to just buy when you see a rounded bottom and heavy negative delta at the lows. You have to see the average volumes when you approached lows previous times to compare to see absorption. The other option is waiting for the confirmation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The beauty of footprint charts and imbalances is that they provide evidence (no guessing). If you were for instance buying every 0.618 blindly before, you can now see with the knowledge of how to read these charts the confirmation. Your win rate will dramatically increase (even double).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:25:46 - EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To see absorption volume needs to increase - heavy selling into the low which is not breaking down. CVD divergences show the absorption.</li>
<li><u>Ingredients of confirmation</u>: upon taking the reference level there should be an increase of volume, a lot of buying imbalances forming on the way up (high positive delta). If reference level does not show these the price can fall down lower and no one loses money buy waiting for a lower price.</li>
<li><u>Second scenario:</u> we claim the reference level and there is evidence of trapped shorts (up-ticking volume, NET longs opening, OI increasing, positive delta with buying imbalances). In this scenario, we get wicks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:38:16 - EXAMPLE (TRAPPED LONGS IN SFP WICK)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the wick, there is a lot of aggressive buying</li>
<li>As soon as you see trapped longs into the high you instantly go back down below your reference level you go into a short position at market. Invalidation is above the high - if price goes back above the high longs are no longer trapped (invalidation).</li>
<li>There should be a lot of selling imbalances when price rejects (high volume)</li>
<li>SFP are good to trade because invalidation is very close and defined.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:46:06 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel changed a lot how he trades nowadays because his time is limited, he only takes best quality trades (high probability trades).</li>
<li><strong>1:0:14 - ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IMBALANCES</strong></li>
<li>it is not about time frame, it is about volume - Daniel likes to look at Volume 5M chart</li>
<li>Daniel uses imbalances at 618 - he likes higher imbalances</li>

<p><strong>00:01:08 - BAT/BTC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CC on the monthly level is a trade Daniel would take every single time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:06:17 - IMBALANCES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The price of the chart will move up or down till at least of these criteria is met.<br/>
<u>Price goes up until</u>
<ul>
<li>New longs no longer want to open</li>
<li>Longs are overwhelmed by shorts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Price goes down</u>
<ul>
<li>New shorts no longer want to open</li>
<li>Shorts are overwhelmed by longs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Volume traded at the price level in the market can either be balanced or imbalanced. When a level is out of balance there are proportionally more buyers or sellers at that level. Daniel likes to use 400-618% to highlight imbalances.</li>
<li>The beginnings of a trend as well as the end of the trend are often marked with market imbalances caused by aggressive participants</li>
<li>Imbalances are not horizontal to each other but in steps (diagonal)</li>
<li>A stacked imbalance is 3 or more on top of one another</li>
<li>When we see a stacking on imbalances we should watch what the market does afterwards. Does the market rally? Does the market sell off? Does it hesitate? Does it get absorbed? When there are big aggressive buyers the market will typically rally. When there are big aggressive sellers the market will typically sell off. If the market does not do what it is supposed to do, the contrary move is likely to be magnified.
<ul>
<li>For example, if there are lots of big aggressive shorts and price is not moving down than it shows that the limit order is absorbing all the sells and a move upwards will likely be strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stacked imbalances can offer support and resistance levels (Daniel does not trade off this theory so much though).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:15:45 - IMBALANCES WHEN BREAKING A LEVEL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel likes to trade looking at imbalances primarily when markets are grinding upwards and when price is breaking a level.</li>
<li>On breaking up you want to see a lot of buying imbalances and when breaking down you want to see a lot of selling imbalances.</li>
<li>It is always needed to see this if you want to trade the breakout or if you see this don’t look to fade</li>
<li>What you would not want to have seen is that upon taking the low get a lot of buying imbalances. That signals that instead of continuation downwards price is likely to get the SFP.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:20:41 - IMBALANCES - ABSORPTION </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price approaches the low of a range with heavy selling imbalances but unable to get any follow through. This highlights to us that passive orders are set absorbing all the market selling and the market could not get through the limit orders so turned and then rallies in the other direction.</li>
<li>Daniel likes to see the evidence of passive buying at the lows (by form of aggressive selling and price not breaking down) and then imbalances as the market pushes up from the low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:24:20 - IMBALANCES - ABSORPTION AT THE HIGH (EXAMPLE)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price is heavily being bought but is not able to go higher - is not doing what is expected - it is very likely it will go in opposite direction strong. Confirmation is upon breaking the low (and quick sell off).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>00:26:44 - IMBALANCES AT THE HIGH/LOW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bearish setup: when there is a very high volume at the wick and then closes lower it is a bearish sign and possible trapped longs. This is best seen when the high of the wick has extremely high volume like a blow off top (extremely high volume in the wick).</li>
<li>Basically, we want to see stacked imbalances in the wick with large volume and of course the candle to close lower than the imbalances. Part two would then be to see selling imbalances to show the market is trying to aggressively sell off.</li>
<li><u>SFP</u> is best traded when you see the reference level taken is very high volume but then retraces below the open with very aggressive selling/buying in the opposite direction. Also keep an eye on volume and OI.</li>
<li>Daniel loves to look for imbalances at the big reference levels such as CC, Weekly, Monthly levels. If there is an evidence market is trying to either:
<ul>
<li>Aggressively selling these levels and market is not moving down</li>
<li>Trapped traders and MS change</li>
<li>Price gets to level and immediately shows aggressive participants showing up with big volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is better to have an alert and wait for the evidence that the market wants to trade at this level rather than just hoping.</li>
<li><u>Daniel’s favourite setups</u>
<ul>
<li>Price slowly grinds down with shorts getting aggressive at each low</li>
<li>Price reaches a key level on the chart, many times a high liquidity area</li>
<li>Price wicks through the level with aggressive shorts, which is immediately bought up with stacked buying imbalances</li>
<li>Price breaks market structure locally and the short squeeze starts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a slow bleed day, he would only consider a long after seeing buying imbalances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:41:05</strong> <strong>- EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>00:49:21 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you see a lot of buying imbalances but OI is falling it is likely people closing out of their positions rather than longs opening.</li>
<li>If you see a lot of selling imbalances but OI is falling it is likely people closing out of their positions rather than shorts opening.</li>
<li>If there are for instance buying imbalances but is not the level Daniel is watching he will not trade that.</li>
<li>You have to put your stop loss at the invalidation (either the low of the wick or two higher lows back etc.)</li>

<p><strong>7:18 - LIQUIDITY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit orders provide liquidity while market orders take liquidity</li>
<li>If you can find a place where a lot of transactions take place, it gives you a perfect opportunity to easily fill bigger position (if price reaches there)</li>
<li>A lot of people have their SL set as a market order, so that is the place where price can grab liquidity and bigger player gets filled. Usually it is below/above the significant low/high</li>
<li>Consolidating area is ‘decision making’ area - where traders are working out where the price should break next (up or down)</li>
<li>Consolidation areas offer good support/resistance - for bigger traders they provide good liquidity areas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13:38 - SFP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an attempt to take a ‘swing’ above or below a significant low/high but failing to do so and instead closing back above/below the previous high/low</li>
<li>SFP’s are also called stop hunts or liquidity grabs (bigger traders fill their positions)</li>
<li>You’d like to trade with bigger traders though so these are good places to open new positions</li>
<li>SFP’s occur on all time frames - the higher the TF the more significant the key level is (bigger effect). They do not always reverse the trend entirely but they can provide nice day or scalp trades (confluence!)</li>
<li>SFP’s can either trade into a short-term retracements or complete reversals</li>

<p><strong>23:32 - HOW TO TRADE SFP (BEGINNER)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for the price to take the high</li>
<li>Wait for a candle to close below the previous high and back within the local range</li>
<li>TP at the bottom of the range</li>
<li>Either compound or let the trade run as price changes MS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>24:58 - HOW TO TRADE SFP (ADVANCED)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for trapped traders
<ul>
<li>High activity at the lows (ideally with POC of the candle at the lows also)</li>
<li>Longs getting stopped out</li>
<li>New short opening at the lows (people turning bearish at support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for demand to show up
<ul>
<li>Big buying imbalances</li>
<li>Increase of OI (new longs opening)</li>
<li>Initial demand occurs when people who got stopped out on short then market buy when price goes opposite way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change in MS (important!)</li>
<li>But do not catch the knife - learn to read the PA</li>
<li>You can also open the starter position when you see trapped traders and demand shows up, and when there is a change in MS you can add</li>

<p><strong>00:03:43 - BNB/BTC COTW</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:13:27 - CVD </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CVD stands for cumulative volume delta, so it is running total of delta.</li>
<li>CVD is adding and removing delta together
<ul>
<li><u>EXAMPLE</u>: we are on 1H TF and we start with 12 mil delta (CVD is 12). The next candle has 57 mil delta, which gives a CVD of 69 (12+57). The following candle is -7.8 mil delta so CVD is now about 61 and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daniel likes to look at delta alone and also CVD delta to look for divergences in price.</li>
<li>For CVD type he has a setting ‘Full data’ which calculates everything while ‘Session’ resets it to zero on the start of every day.</li>
<li>CVD divergences are very powerful indicator because we can see what bigger traders are doing</li>
<li>Passive orders at limit provide liquidity to the market and one can get paid for providing liquidity to the market (whereas market orders are expensive).</li>
<li>We want to see divergences build up over period of time, rather than a one candle drop/wick/stop run that forms a divergence. Also as CVD is calculated using the whole candle we look at divergences using the whole candle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:23:40 - BULLISH CVD DIVERGENCE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>EXAMPLE</u>: There is a move to the downside and price goes sideways for a period of time and then attempts to move down again. Price forms a higher low but CVD makes a lower low. This shows us there are more people market shorting over the period of the higher low on price than at the lower low. Also, that shows us there is/are a bigger trader(s) with a big limit order(s) absorbing all of the market sells. Confirmation of a long would be a break of MS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:28:12 - BEARISH CVD DIVERGENCE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>EXAMPLE</u>: Price is making lower highs while CVD is making higher highs. This show people are aggressively market buying but the price is unable to take the high because there is/are a bigger trader(s) absorbing all the buys with the limit order(s). Confirmation of a short would be a break of MS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:32:18 - CVD ‘QUICK WICK’ DIVERGENCES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a very quick wick to the downside which forms a divergence. Daniel never trades off of this, he likes to see the divergences form over several candles which shows absorption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:37:34 - CVD ‘CONFIRMATION’</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CVD divergences have two steps
<ul>
<li>The possible divergence forming</li>
<li>Confirmed divergences (price starts to move away after they have formed and those traders are trapped). Daniel likes to see how many trapped traders there are, if there is decent volume.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes you will see instances of delta leading price. It will look like CVD divergences are forming only for a price to then follow/ catch up. Monitor delta, volume of the range, time taken for each rotation, other confluences + CONTEXT.</li>
<li>Not all divergences play out so do not blindly short/long. It takes time and experience to recognise which ones to trade and which ones to believe delta is leading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:44:10 - CVD/DELTA LEADING PRICE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it looks like there bearish divergences are forming but then price catches up with the delta and shortly breaks up too. So, waiting for confirmation is one option but understanding the content of what price is doing when at the high, and how it approached the high is next level.</li>
<li>MS is crucially important - when price changes MS or moves down from the high on an increase of negative delta it means bears have taken control after trapping longs at the high.</li>
<li>CVD divergences can be traded on any TF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:59:12 - EXAMPLE OF SFP</strong></p>
<p><strong>01:01:50 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on exchange you are trading on</li>
<li>Daniel only trades the two divergences he mentioned here</li>
<li>The advantage of waiting for confirmation is that you are less likely to get stopped out (you make less money but you are less likely to lose money)</li>

<p><strong>00:10:56 - DELTA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta is very important to understand</li>
<li>In trading, there is
<ul>
<li><u>Passive order flow</u> = limit orders (they either get filled or don’t)</li>
<li><u>Active/aggressive order flow</u> = market orders (you get filled 100%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a passive order to get filled you need an active order to fill it. The market only moves from market orders, if nobody ever placed a market order the market would stay still and not move.</li>
<li>Delta is the sum of aggressive trades. It shows us who was in control during that candle. It is either positive or negative.</li>
<li><u>Delta = buys - sells</u></li>
<li>You can literally see delta for every 0.5 dollar in a candle and at the bottom of the chart there is the overall delta for the whole candle.</li>
<li>A candle can be green while delta is being negative or the candle can be red and the delta positive - there are also inverse correlations and strategies</li>
<li><u>Two key question to ask yourself when wanting to trade:</u>
<ul>
<li>What direction is the market trying to go?
<ul>
<li>See the MS on a HTF</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it doing a good job in its attempt to go that way?
<ul>
<li>From delta and volume perspective: knowing that market moves from active orders if price moves higher than we would want to see the volume amount of active orders also increasing.</li>
<li>If that is TRUE the market is doing a good job in its attempt to go that way</li>
<li>If FALSE and price is moving up with a decrease in active orders (positive delta) it is not doing a good job and likely will reverse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:24:33 - DELTA CLUSTER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta clusters show us areas on the chart with high delta. If we see an area on the chart with a high delta concentration we could expect price to revert there if revisited.</li>
<li>Daniel gives a good example.</li>
<li>If price passes through high delta cluster a few times it is not relevant anymore.</li>
<li>Daniel is mostly looking at these delta clusters more at the highs and at the lows, they should be untested</li>
<li>As the price breaks out of the range you want to see positive delta (and volume) increasing as it shows you new money is coming in to buy at these levels and that will support price when it breaks out.</li>
<li>Breakout on low delta is considered bearish as price is moving up with less interest from active buyers and it is more likely price will return back to the range (SFP is possible)</li>
<li>So, moving up on low volume is possible but is a ‘red signal’.</li>
<li>Delta helps to confirm a breakout instantly. Daniel loves to trade using delta and OI to see when price approaches low/high is this likely to be a fakeout/SFP or are we going to see follow through.</li>
<li>If price braches a high and the high is taken on a large delta influx along with the NET longs increasing Daniel would not short the break but he would market buy with strength. Bid/ask profile should look like P with then follow through taking the high.</li>
<li>The advantage of this is we don’t have to wait for an arbitrary 5 minute close / 15 minute close above the level. We can see the delta straight away is supporting the breakout and react in seconds. Waiting for a 15 minute close for instance can result in a trade missed.</li>
<li>The reason we want to see an increase in positive delta when we break a high is that it shows we have more active buyers coming into the market to support price.</li>
<li>If price breaks a level on high volume but on negative delta the fakeout sign can be confirmed if price comes back into the range in increase in negative delta, volume, NET shorts and OI increase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:50:14 - DELTA RANGES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the high of the range is reached and delta of the buys falls off significantly then it highlights buyers are not interested in buying this high and it is more likely to remain range bound and come back lower.</li>
<li>If the low of the range is reached and delta of the sells falls off significantly then it highlights sellers are not interested in selling this low and it is more likely to remain range bound and come back higher.</li>
<li>Generally, when price is range bound we will see active selling increase at the top and active buying increase at the bottom. If this does not occur, and then price breaks out of the range on increasing delta it is likely to get follow through (especially if OI from both sides is built up during the range).</li>
<li>If the price is ranging and the lows are getting bought up with strong positive delta and the highs are not aggressively sold we can say this range is more likely to break upwards.</li>
<li>Delta is very important statistic when trading a range. It gives heads up if it is ‘wise’ to short the range highs or buy consolidation under resistance. Likewise buy the low of the range or short consolidation over support. There have to be at least two rotations to decide so. CVD helps a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>01:03:36 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it can happen that the highs of a range are being sold heavily but then the price starts consolidating under resistance and then takes the high on an increase of positive delta and breaks out. CONTEXT!</li>
<li>High volume cluster does not mean that this is the POC of the day, POC can happen any time in a range but if it does that is another level of confluence.</li>

<p><strong>00:09:24 - WRX/BTC UPDATE</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:18:14 - FOOTPRINT CHARTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is extremely invaluable to be able to see the amount of volume transacted at each price in a candle.</li>
<li>For instance, if there is a long lower wick you may think it is bullish but by being able to see exactly where the majority of the volume is within this candle is more helpful. For instance, if all the volume is at the high of the candle and price is closing below the high it is not ‘bullish’.
<ul>
<li><u>EXAMPLE</u>: price is going sideways near the bottom of the range. A new candle opens, gets a high and at the high 100 million contracts are market sold + a 100 million limit order was hit. Someone sees 200 million sell walls and sells 100 million contracts and all of that flushes the market down very quickly. The orderbook has been wiped out and it gets bought up on one million market buy to bring the price back up. Without footprint chart, you are not able to see this and may think this is bullish candle (with long lower wick) but it is actually not at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being able to see where we have a lot of buyers and sellers horizontally can assist us in a far superior fashion to interpret supports and resistances. Seeing acceptance below or above a key level is only possible using a footprint chart. Acceptance below or above the level is dependent on volume transacted. When there was a move above the range on low volume it is generally not accepted (people are not willing to trade at these levels and it has to come back to a fair value).</li>
<li>Importantly being able to see acceptance below or above a key level is only possible using a footprint chart, a candle stick cannot show this.</li>
<li><u>OHCL</u> - open, high, close, low of a candle</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:25:41 - FOOTPRINT CHARTS - COMPARE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel uses bid/ask profile on lower TFs when day trading. He sees live the buying and selling interest when price approaches a key level.</li>
<li>On bid/ask profile sell is on the left side and buy on the right side. If price revisits the level where the was a lot of buying or selling on one side many people are likely to go out of the trade break-even.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> When price is ranging the clues that it may break out would be:
<ul>
<li><u>Breaking to the upside</u> = buying volume heavily increasing at the top of the range, positive delta increasing as price increases, NET longs increasing. POCs should be increasing (higher) on each candle and bid/ask full to the right (P).</li>
<li><u>Breaking to the downside</u> = selling volume heavily increasing at the bottom of the range, negative delta increasing as price decreases, NET shorts increasing. POCs should be decreasing (lower) on each candle and bid/ask full to the left (d).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:52:31 - FOOTPRINT CHARTS - VOLUME CLUSTERS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Areas where there are dark colours are showing there is more volume and where there are very light colours there is not much volume.</li>
<li>Daniel likes looking at the volume cluster on a high time frame and looks for darkly shaded areas. This highlights to high traded areas in terms of volume and if he has other technical tools lining up with that level it presents a good trade opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:58:31 - FOOTPRINT CHARTS - IMBALANCES </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imbalances are calculated diagonally</li>
<li>Daniel has a setting that shows him imbalance when there is a 400% imbalance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>01:00:30 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to see the total volume transacted (on Exo) you have to change in the ‘text’ from bid/ask to volume</li>
<li>As a swing trader, you can use all this information taught today for easier identifying supports and resistances.</li>

<p><strong>00:02:47 - BTC SENTIMENT, STATS AND TA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>Backwordation</u>: spot price trading higher than futures</li>
<li><u>Contango</u>: futures price is trading higher than spot</li>
<li>When you see a pattern that is repeating you want to make use of this knowledge and not just ignore.</li>
<li>Also remember: when price is going sideways and OBV is breaking up = bullish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:34:20 - SESSION VOLUME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a good way of seeing the pivotal VAL, VAH and POC’s from each trading session (24H periods for crypto)</li>
<li>Each of these levels are used as support/resistance and are very important levels to be aware of for day traders. Daniel checks all these levels for the past day (pdVAL, pdVAH, pdPOC) and writes them down on paper before he stars trading.</li>
<li>The main focus for swing traders are ‘Naked POCs’ - this is where a POC from previous session has not been tapped. It generally gives a bounce when approached for the first time but as always look for confluence.</li>
<li>Naked POC’s are a place on the chart where there was the most transacted volume so when price breaks away from that price 95% of traders that got the direction wrong would love to get out of that trade at break-even price when price revisits it. That is why the <u>first</u> touch of POC is such a strong support/resistance - there are a lot of people getting out break-even plus some traders like Daniel are also setting bids on Naked POC to ‘double the strength’. Daniel only pre-sets bids there if there is AT LEAST 1 confluence on that level (e.g. CC or weekly/monthly). It happens at least once a week that they line up.</li>
<li>On TradingView it is called ‘Session volume’</li>
<li>Daniel prefers to see the reaction first and get in straight after (90% of his trades). Though, sometimes he does pre-set orders waiting at the level and one of his favourite setups to do this is on Naked POC’s with confluence at that level with another tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:44:19 - EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Session volume does not change either you set your TF on 1 day or 15 minutes - on small TF you just get more in-depth view.</li>
<li>If price gets acceptance into VAH (price going down) price is likely to go to at least POC if not VAL. If price bounces off of VAH in uptrend it is bullish.</li>
<li>If price auctions above pdVAH, forms a bit of a distribution pattern and breaks back down into pdVAH, there is 80% probabilities of auction back down to pdVAL. It means price was not accepted above that high. The same goes for if price is in a range, it drops down but then gets acceptance into pdVAL there is 80% probabilities of auction back to pdVAH.</li>

<li>The highlighted area is where the highest percentage of volume is (68%)</li>
<li><u>VAL</u> = the low of highlighted area</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>00:25:02 - ATTEMPTS TO BREAK A RANGE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be very cautious of volume when in sideways range. The volume at the breakout cannot be smaller than on the break down (or up) that starts a range. Compare how you get in and how you get out.</li>

<li>VAH - one would start looking for shorts</li>
<li>VAL - one would start looking for longs</li>
<li>POC - one would not look for a position (midpoint TP usually)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the price starts to move outside of the VAH one would like to close shorts = acceptance above the range (people are starting to see value)</li>
<li>If you are robotically trading the range one trade will 100% be a loss (break of the range). To prevent that one should look at various things:
<ul>
<li><u>Time</u>: how long each rotation takes (low to high/high to low). For instance, if your average time is 10 min ant the last move takes only 5 min on high volume = increase of buying pressure</li>
<li><u>Volume</u></li>
<li><u>Delta</u></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, when you are coming to highs you can see how aggressively they have been sold and when you are coming to lows you can see how aggressively they are being bought</li>

<ul>
<li>OBV is the cumulative total of volume (positive and negative)</li>
<li>OBV is a leading indicator - volume leads price</li>
<li>One can trade patterns (TA) on OBV - if OBV breaks downwards we can expect price to break down soon. Some people trade off of this and it works for them. Daniel does not though.</li>
<li>OBV can be used for identifying divergences at tops and bottoms</li>
<li>Price making HH and OBV making HH = healthy uptrend (new money coming in)</li>
<li>Price makes new highs but OBV does not = bearish</li>
<li>Price is consolidating but OBV is going down = bearish</li>
<li>Price is consolidating but OBV is going up = bullish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:49:37 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OBV is calculated from candle closes but Daniel looks at wicks when price is ranging because PA reached there and it is still important to him.</li>
<li>When looking for divergences though, one can look from candle closes because you are looking at divergences at market highs/lows</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A good example of WYCKOFF</li>

<p><strong>00:16:57 - VOLUME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel trades coins with 200+ 24H BTC volume (even better 24H change + 24H volume)</li>
<li>Liquidity is extremely important without it you lose money</li>
<li>Volume is a great tool to confirm a trend</li>
<li><u>Spread</u> is a difference between buy and sell (for instance buy bid is 25$, sell ask is 26$ - spread is 1$). You do not want to trade something with big spread because it means liquidity is low = you will lose money</li>
<li><u>Slippage</u> = when something drops quickly and there is low liquidity you for instance have SL set at 5% but you get filled at 25%. Your loss is very big = rekt.</li>
<li>Daniel has volume MA set on 30 on TV. It means that it takes last 30 periods (on 1D TF it takes 30 days, on 1H TF it takes 30 hours)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:54:06 - EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very good example on BTC.
<ul>
<li>Sell volume on retrace was higher than the biggest bull volume in the uptrend = reversal</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>If correction happens too fast it is more likely that it is only one leg of correction, meaning it will likely go sideways after that for longer time</p>
<p><strong>01:09:09 - COMMENTS AND Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time fib can be used on any time frame but as always, the higher the time frame the more profitable (4H+ TF)</li>
<li>You do not use Fib time just on impulsive moves but you can also pull fib time from the start of the correction (high) to the end of the correction (low) to the next top (next LH).
<ul>
<li><u>EXAMPLE</u>:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the high (5) - first pivot, low (W) - second pivot, next (lower) high (X) - third pivot, so (Y) is likely to be 1-1 extension. It is important to click on the exact day of the high/low!</p>
<p>Also, to get price target you can pull fib extension from the high (5) - first pivot, low (W) - second pivot, next (lower) high (X) - third pivot and also target 1-1.</p>
<p>Altogether now you get the approximate date and approximate price target. How amazing is that!</p>

<ul>
<li>Daniel uses it for stock market</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:35:04 - ADX (AVERAGE DIRECTIONAL INDEX)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Great for swing trades</li>
<li>It can determine how strong the trend is and in which direction it is going</li>
<li>0-25 not a strong trend, 25-50 average trend, 50-75 very strong trend, 75-100 strongest trend</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>00:15:31 - DIVERGENCES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel never, ever, ever trades from divergences alone</li>
<li>He does not really use indicators, he looks at them last to just add to confluence</li>
<li>Noobs are obsessed with them and 95% lose money (so think …)</li>
<li><em>EXAMPLE:</em> price goes sideways for some time then massive move to the upside occurs, a little drop and another move up. This type of action will always show bearish divergences - momentum on secondary rise cannot be the same as on the first one. So, it does not mean you should short</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Price makes a higher high</li>
<li>Oscillator makes lower high</li>
<li>Bear in mind that calculations on oscillators are calculated from candle closes not wicks. Bearish divergences can be useful if price comes into HTF resistance (buying drying out).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:31:15 - HIDDEN BULLISH DIVERGENCES = CONTINUATION OF UPTREND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price makes a higher low</li>
<li>Oscillator makes lower low</li>

<ul>
<li>Price makes a lower high</li>
<li>Oscillator makes higher high</li>
<li>In downtrend price rises into resistance = short the rally</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:37:53 - DIVERGENCES CLASS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is impossible to predict divergences, depends on momentum (they lag)</li>
<li>Divergences are useful on LTF when you are scalping (tiny pullbacks) - just do not expect too much of them</li>

<li>SL are above the high and above the low (be smart with placement).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>32.24 - OVER AND UNDER CHANNEL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You get heads up view of where the trend is going</li>
<li><u>BEARISH UNDER OVER</u>: price runs upwards out of the channel, take stops and goes back down on high sell volume, break out of the channel downwards. Now you look to short the mid to high of the channel (ladder) when you come back in and SL above the high.</li>
<li><u>BULLISH OVER UNDER</u>: price runs downwards out of the channel, take stops and goes back up on high buy volume, break out of the channel upwards. Now you look to long the mid to high of the channel (ladder) when you come back in and SL is below the low</li>
<li>Generally, you take a measured move of channel to get targets (confluences …)</li>

<p><strong>00:04:00 - REN COTW</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:12:14 - ONE OF MY SCALPING STRATEGIES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BB, EMA’s, horizontals and fibs</li>
<li>Daniel uses 3-5 min chart for scalping</li>
<li>When volatility is low he uses 3 min chart, when volatility is high he uses 5 min chart (5%+ moves on BTC) because there can be some false signals</li>
<li>It is a counter trend strategy</li>
<li>You need to have time. Trade takes from a few minutes to an hour.</li>
<li>Of course, this is not ‘magic’ strategy but with good risk management should be profitable</li>
</ul>
<p><em>SO:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Add horizontals (S/R, <strong>M</strong>onthly, <strong>W</strong>eekly, <strong>D</strong>aily)</li>
<li>Add EW (dependant on direction you may only favour longs/shorts</li>
<li>Add moving up &amp; down % crossing and add RSI alerts (15. 5. 19 Champions stream)</li>
<li>Add fibs</li>
<li>Still, you do not take every single trade (you have to get a feel)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>THEN:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You enter a limit order on the close of the candle that closes outside the BB (not wick)</li>
<li>TP1: EMA 8, TP2: EMA 12, TP3: EMA 26</li>
<li>For 0.5% gain you place SL at 0.2% loss</li>
<li>In extreme volatility, you place SL at 1% loss and target at 2% gain</li>
<li>When TP1 is hit you move SL to entry</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>00:38:57 - ADDING COMPLEXITY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, when you see bullish divergences or confluences with important levels (fibs, horizontals …) you can increase position size and let the trade ride longer</li>
<li>Trade with momentum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>00:49:21 - BTC EXAMPLES and Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on win % - consistency</li>
<li>Never market buy (fees eat up profit)</li>
<li>Use risk management or use certain amount each time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>01:01:24 - FROM PLAIN CHART - AVERAGE DAY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When Daniel starts with plain chart he marks:
<ul>
<li>(<strong>M</strong>onthly, <strong>W</strong>eekly, <strong>D</strong>aily)</li>
<li>Fibs (HTF)</li>
<li>Daily EMA (he writes down on paper daily <strong>55EMA</strong> and 4H <strong>55EMA</strong>)</li>
<li><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">P.S.</em> <span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Daniel uses </span><strong style=""font-size: 16px;"">4EMA+DC+BB</strong><span style=""font-size: 16px;""> indicator on TV (he made it, it is public)</span></li>

<li>Daniel recommends that every week you delete completely everything from the chart and start from scratch. You lose bias and have a fresh start</li>
<li><u>MARKING A CHART</u>:
<ul>
<li>Mark horizontals (<strong>M</strong>onthly, <strong>W</strong>eekly, <strong>D</strong>aily)</li>
<li>Go on 4H TF and draw a channel, trendlines, Fibs, EW etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to mark wicks but candle closes are way more relevant (when marking horizontals)</li>
<li>For marking levels, you are looking for an area where price has got a few candles in a row and then you get a rejection which is followed by few candles on the opposite side</li>
<li>Daniel likes to mark Monday open</li>
