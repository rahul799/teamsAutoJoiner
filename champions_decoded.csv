<ul>
<li>When the level is old and it had been tapped in the past, Daniel would normally not mark it on his chart anymore but if the level is still very respected and important, he leaves it on</li>
<li>Daniel always marks the lower VAL and the higher VAH</li>
<li>When there is a nPOC with no confluence it is not so probable that the price will bounce there but when there are a few POC’s on or close to nPOC, it is a very strong level</li>
<li>Also, if nPOC is at the important level it adds to confluence</li>
<li>nPOC’s do not always give reversals but in general they offer good scalp trades (1-5% in general)</li>
<li>The overall low and the low of an impulse are both valid to pull from - consider the one that is more respected as it may work best</li>
<li>It is more likely that the less steep trend line will be more respected</li>
<li>When there is a psychological level on ETH being hit and BTC is also hitting support it is likely it bounces (nice confluence)</li>
<li>Daniel is good at having entries from exact lows and exact highs (he is always well prepared)</li>
<li>It is very helpful to have a line in the sand from which you can expect much lower/much higher</li>
<li>Wave 4 cannot come into wave 1 - invalidation</li>
<li>As a trader, you need to be prepared for every possible scenario</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>54:49 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can recognize high liquidity areas from experience - where would people put their SL’s?</li>
<li>Daniel generally just uses 0.618 and 0.75 on speedfan</li>
<li>With waiting for HTF market structure change you miss the move if you are waiting for the move but it is good to be aware of it</li>
<li>EWs are very helpful as they have clear invalidations</li>
<li>Daniel uses diagonal trendlines only with EW counts</li>
<li>CME gap is good to be aware of but not to base a trade off of it</li>

<li>Sometimes you need to be aggressive with entering trades</li>
<li>You always need to know how much you want to hedge your portfolio, how much you are willing to risk on trades (R:R ratio)</li>
<li>Daniel is constantly hedging in order to protect his capital and is not/less bothered if the price goes up without him taking a trade</li>
<li>When price drops he is not only loosing BTC but also spot value - that is why he is much more aggressive on shorts</li>
<li>Wave 4 can either be running flat (very bullish) or expanded flat</li>
<li>Daniel is not bearish, he is just very good at hedging at very high levels</li>
<li>When bullish, every drop is a gift</li>
<li>Significant low on significant time pivot offers a very good trade</li>
<li>Daniel uses trendlines as invalidation on EW count</li>
<li>When price holds a trend line there is a good probability of price going higher</li>

<p><strong>14:16 - BTC TA DANIEL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel is marking the levels while Mike and Victor commentate</li>
<li>The thing with patterns is that when everybody is looking at the same thing it is not very likely to play out</li>
<li>So many people are talking about the dead cross but as a trader you cannot really get much information with this - it does not give you the trade. Whenever it happens you are already late to the move (very speculative)</li>
<li>When seeing a pattern, you have to think like a bigger player - how to generate liquidity (counter trade)</li>
<li>When price goes up, Daniel thinks about shorts and when price goes down he thinks about longs</li>
<li>Mike trades much different when scalping then swing trading</li>
<li>Daniel looks at the LTF for an entry even for his swing trades to get the best possible entry and then he takes a TP1 rather fast and lets the rest riding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>27:37 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<li>The tick size matters, for day trading 50 ticks is optimal</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Pre-setting orders can be dangerous, it is better to set an alert</li>
<li>Fib time is coming at the end of this month</li>
<li>Daniel uses EWs only on HTF and Mike also - he likes to use them with harmonics and speed fans</li>
<li>The correlation with stock market is not so strong nowadays but it is still good to keep an eye on it</li>
<li>Daniel sees every drop in the stock market as a buying opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1:20:18 - BTC TA VICTOR + WRAP UP BY DANIEL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victor is sticking to trading a range</li>
<li>Pre-setting with a good risk management can still be profitable, everyone has to decide themselves what they prefer.</li>
<li>The only thing you need to know in trading is which levels you are interested in trading in whichever direction price goes (plan - always be prepared) but you do not need to know what will happen next</li>
<li>Trade of the week for Daniel would still be the SFP of the highs around 40k region</li>

<p><strong>2:00 - PREVIOUS WEEK OVERVIEW + BTC TA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel goes through the set-up from the previous week and talks about the next possible scenarios that can happen</li>
<li>There is a possibility of a descending triangle if LH’s cannot be broken</li>
<li>There is still a possible set-up of shorting the range high but Daniel would not pre-set and would be cautious (he wants to see SFP). No SFP, no trade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12:33 - MIKE’S BTC TA</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:12 - Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel, Mike and Victor do not care about the death cross (200&amp;50 EMA cross) because EMA’s are lagging and it is totally irrelevant to the way they trade</li>
<li>Trendlines are very arbitrary - there are different options how to pull them</li>
<li>When in no trade, the best swing trades are at the top or at the bottom of the range</li>
<li>Best way to trade is setting the alerts and then see the reaction</li>
<li>In Daniel’s opinion, it is much more bullish to break down from the descending triangle than running the highs first</li>
<li>Daniel doesn’t care if he misses a trade</li>
<li>Mike sometimes trades back-test of a break out but only as a scalp or day trade. But if he sees the momentum is great he sometimes holds it as a swing trade.</li>
<li>It is context depended, in general break-out trading is not the best idea</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1:08:38 - WRAP UP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Patience is a key</li>
<li>Always know what type of the trade you are aiming for - if you enter a scalp trade, you take profits early but if you enter a swing trades, you cannot close the trade too early</li>

<li>He also does the EW count where the most bullish scenario would be going sideways for half a year</li>
<li>The more bearish count would see BTC go to about 13k</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>56:29 - WRAP UP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There always have to be two possible Elliott Wave counts - a more bullish and a more bearish count. The breakout direction of this range will be the factor to decide which count to follow long term (for about 200 days)</li>

<p><strong>1:09:07 - DANIEL’S FINAL THOUGHTS (SPOKEN)</strong></p>

<li>Mike likes to mark global VAH of the whole Bybit chart</li>

<ul>
<li>With the price ranging for a longer period of time, fading a move could be a bit dangerous - you have to monitor price</li>

If ETH is doing well, altcoins do well also<br/>
Never FOMO but wait for retracements</p>

<p><strong>57:57 - Q&amp;A</strong><br/>
Whatever comes out from the current range will give us the idea where we are on EW chart (level to level)<br/>
With EW, you always have to have a bullish and a bearish count<br/>
Daniel knows when to get aggressive on a trade<br/>
Daniel trades on Bybit only which means he can only long ETH/USD, ETH/USDT or just hold spot ETH<br/>
If ETH/BTC looks good but BTC is at a major resistance he would convert spot BTC into spot ETH<br/>
If ETH/BTC looks good and BTC also looks good he’d leverage long ETH/USD and ETH/USDT</p>

<p><strong>4:07 - PREVIOUS WEEK OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>10:06 - BTC TA</strong><br/>
Daniel always keeps the levels and channels that are very respected in the past because they may come back into play again<br/>
Until market structure changes (break the lower high), there is no reason to think price will not go lower<br/>
The higher the TF the clearer it is<br/>
You have to recognize the early signs of bull market going into bear market or even still being in a bull market but the bigger correction incoming - you have to recognise when to stop buying the dip (till there is a sign of strength - resistance flipped into support)<br/>
Daniel goes through EW count to see what is the most probable now<br/>
What is the most obvious is the least probable to happen<br/>
Three way pullbacks are way more bullish than five way pullbacks<br/>
In trading, you have to protect your capital first. It is better to not take a trade than blindly take a trade and loose</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>50:52 - Q&amp;A</strong><br/>
Daniel now thinks we are in a wave 4 correction even if we get above the trendline again (B wave - then short for C)<br/>
Daniel does trade altcoins as he is holding USDT also<br/>
The easiest way to trade is off of MS<br/>
With not taking a trade you don’t lose any money, Daniel never gets annoyed because there is always another opportunity<br/>
Anything can happen but you always have to think what is the most probable to</p>

<p><strong>3:55 - PREVIOUS WEEK OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7:06 - BTC TA</strong><br/>
Daniel starts from scratch</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>34:35 - Q&amp;A</strong><br/>
Daniel likes to look at things he finds on the chart himself<br/>
He has his key levels and trades them<br/>
Time POC and volume POC are slightly different, Daniel goes for the higher resistance and lower support. He wants the highest possible level to short and lowest possible to long<br/>
Daniel pulls fixed range from different pivots to get different ranges of volume and to see when the most volume was transacted. Locally is more relevant for day traders and bigger range volume is more important for swing traders<br/>
Daniel would consider wave 3 being in if 50k is lost. While price holds it, it may still not be in as it is an area of support<br/>
Speed fan is debatable where you pull it from. Daniel goes for the low that give the most respected touches and gives a bit more time to the move. Also, the pivot he uses was the range low of that range - which is a significant low for that section of the chart<br/>
Daniel favours shorting BTC, so to fully close the short he needs to see some strength.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>46:18 - POSSIBLE TRADE SETUP</strong><br/>
Losing 50k would flip it into a very big resistance<br/>
Daniel stays in his short (simultaneously) until sign of strength<br/>
If 50k is lost there is a potential for a very drawn out correction<br/>
By looking for different potential scenarios and having plan you are always prepared for the next trade</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>57:03 - Q&amp;A</strong><br/>
Daniel is always in a short in a local downtrend<br/>
It is nice to hold your short position when you get a nice entry. Then when price comes to a support area you can open a long (on another account) and keep on holding the short position until you get the sign of strength. So, if long gets invalidated you are still profiting from the short that is running - you are hedged.</p>

<p><strong>3:51 - BTC TA</strong><br/>
Daniel marks all the levels<br/>
Daniel prefers to take a loss when he sees a good trade opportunity rather than being scared and missing the trade (when you have a proper risk management, loss does not ‘hurt’)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15:18 - MIKE’S VIEW</strong><br/>
Mike takes only the highest probability trades and if the trade does not present itself he simply does not trade that day</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>22:47 - IGOR’S VIEW</strong><br/>
Igor is a level to level trader and he likes to trade sessions<br/>
Igor removes all the prices on the right side, he just leaves prices of important levels to remove bias and just be focused on that exact level<br/>
He likes POC’s and is only interested in big levels<br/>
Even when you know everything, you cannot just avoid losses. No one has 100% win rate, we only trade probabilities. You need to learn how to deal with losses.</p>

<li>ABCD pattern is basic, easy to learn</li>
<li>Other patterns stem from this one</li>
<li>BOOK: The guide of harmonic patterns EXACT TITLE????</li>
<li>Interesting ‘fact’ - so many people lose their money in an uptrend. One of the reasons is because of the complex pullback</li>
<li>Complex pullback: price comes through the previous high on the correction. Important thing is that the low holds. It confuses people who trade EW (for instance wave 4 cannot go into wave 1) - that’s why one has to have more than 1 trading strategy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>21:46 - CLASSIC ABCD PATTERN (+EXAMPLE)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Best on 4H + TF</li>
<li>C = between 0.618 and 0.786</li>
<li>D = if C is 0.618 then look for 1.618 of Fibonacci expansion from B to C</li>
<li>D = if C is 0.786 then look for 1.272 of Fibonacci expansion from B to C</li>
<li>Officially you trade the D leg but Daniel trades C leg as well</li>
<li>Short or long D (confluence is needed)
<ul>
<li>Take a Fib from A to D</li>
<li>Targets: 0.382, 0.618, A (or trail SL from 0.382)</li>
<li>SL: below 1.618 expansion from B to C</li>
<li>The symmetry between AB and CD is needed (Fib time)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>52:10 - BTC TA and Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:12:57 - AB = CD PATTERN</strong></p>

<li>AB is the 1-1 extension of CD (take Fib extension from A to B to C and D is 1-1)</li>
